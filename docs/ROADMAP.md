## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Learning Curve (.NET)**
   - Mitigation: Allocate extra time, use documentation, ask community
   
2. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Stick to roadmap, document "nice-to-haves" for later
   
3. **Database Performance**
   - Mitigation: Index optimization, caching strategy, load testing
   
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: Regular audits, security-focused code reviews, penetration testing

---

## Questions to Answer

- [ ] Do we want real-time features from the start? (SignalR)
- [ ] Should we implement rate limiting from day one?
- [ ] Do we need caching (Redis) immediately or can we add it later?
- [ ] Should achievements be in Phase 5 or Phase 6?
- [ ] What's the target launch date?

---

## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Track Progress**: Check off items as completed
2. **Update Regularly**: Review and adjust every 2 weeks
3. **Document Changes**: Note why priorities shifted
4. **Celebrate Milestones**: Mark phase completions
5. **Stay Flexible**: Adapt based on learnings
