# Puzloc Project Summary

## What Is This?

Puzloc is a **multi-game puzzle platform** that started as a learning project to explore technologies like .NET, PostgreSQL, SvelteKit, and Nx monorepos. It features two main puzzle games:

1. **NumLock** 🔢 - A Wordle-inspired 4-digit code-breaking game
2. **PhraseLock** 📝 - A Hangman-style phrase guessing game

## Current Status: Foundation Complete ✅

As of October 16, 2025, the project foundation is fully set up:

### ✅ What's Been Done

**Infrastructure**
- Nx monorepo initialized and configured
- Docker Compose setup with PostgreSQL, Redis, and pgAdmin
- Complete database schema designed and scripted
- Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore

**Documentation**
- Comprehensive README with project overview
- Detailed architecture documentation
- Complete game rules specification
- Getting started guide for developers
- Contributing guidelines
- Development roadmap (15-week plan)

### 🎯 Core Concept

**NumLock Game**
- Player guesses a 4-digit code
- 6 attempts maximum
- Feedback for each digit:
  - 🟢 Correct position
  - 🟡 Wrong position
  - ⚫ Not in code
- Score based on attempts and time
- Daily challenges with leaderboards

**PhraseLock Game**
- Player reveals a hidden phrase
- Guess letters or the whole phrase
- 10 lives (attempts)
- Letter guesses cost 1 life if wrong
- Phrase guesses cost 2 lives if wrong
- Categories and difficulty levels
- Daily challenges with leaderboards

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

**Backend** (.NET 8)
- RESTful API
- JWT authentication
- Entity Framework Core + PostgreSQL
- Game logic services
- Statistics and leaderboards

**Frontend** (SvelteKit)
- Responsive web interface
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Real-time game interactions
- Leaderboards and statistics

**Shared Packages**
- `@puzloc/game-engine` - Core game algorithms (can run on client or server)
- `@puzloc/shared-types` - TypeScript types shared across stack
- `@puzloc/api-client` - Type-safe API client for frontends

### 📊 Database Schema

Tables created:
- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `challenges` - Daily puzzles for each game
- `attempts` - Individual guess attempts
- `game_sessions` - Complete game sessions
- `user_stats` - Aggregated player statistics
- `leaderboard_entries` - Cached leaderboard data
- `achievements` - Gamification system
- `user_achievements` - Player achievements
- `refresh_tokens` - JWT refresh tokens

### 🎓 Learning Goals

This project is designed to explore:
- ✅ .NET backend development (new for the author!)
- ✅ PostgreSQL database design
- ✅ JWT authentication patterns
- ✅ SvelteKit frontend development
- ✅ Nx monorepo management
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ RESTful API design
- ✅ Full-stack TypeScript

### 🚀 Next Steps

**Immediate** (Phase 1: Weeks 1-3)
1. Create .NET Web API project
2. Set up Entity Framework Core
3. Implement authentication (register, login, JWT)
4. Create user management endpoints
5. Build core game infrastructure

**Short Term** (Phases 2-3: Weeks 4-9)
1. Implement NumLock game logic
2. Create NumLock API endpoints
3. Build SvelteKit frontend
4. Create game UI components
5. Implement leaderboards and statistics

**Medium Term** (Phases 4-5: Weeks 10-15)
1. Add PhraseLock game
2. Multi-game integration
3. Testing and bug fixes
4. Production deployment
5. Launch! 🎉

## Fun Facts

- **Name Origin**: "Puzloc" = Puzzle + Lock (like unlocking challenges)
- **Inspiration**: Wordle, Hangman, Countdown TV show
- **Initial Concept Change**: Started as just NumLock, added PhraseLock during planning
- **Tech Stack Choice**: .NET chosen specifically as a learning challenge
- **"ELK Question"**: We considered adding ELK stack but decided it was overkill for a learning project 😄
